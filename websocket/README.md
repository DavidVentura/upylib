#WebSocket Protocol for [MicroPython](http://www.micropython.org)

Currently just a procedural experiment to establish and test the coding
and decoding of [WebSockets](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455) in
cpython / micropython.

Intention is to incorporate, as optional/loadable functionality into a wider 
http protocol server. 

Uses [Python Sha-1](https://github.com/ajalt/python-sha1) module
